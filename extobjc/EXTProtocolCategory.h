/**
 * \@pcategoryinterface defines the interface for a category named \a CATEGORY on protocol \a
 * PROTOCOL. Protocol categories contain methods that are automatically applied
 * to any class that declares itself to conform to \a PROTOCOL. This macro
 * should be used in header files.
 *
 * @note This macro actually defines an interface against \c NSObject, meaning
 * that classes not inheriting from \c NSObject may cause compiler warnings
 * about not responding to the category's methods. Such warnings can be
 * disregarded, as the category will still be loaded normally.
 *
 * @warning Protocol categories function similarly to normal categories in that
 * they will overwrite any existing methods. Just like regular categories, the
 * order in which conflicting protocols overwrite each other is indeterminate.
 * These behaviors are even more dangerous in the case of protocols, where the
 * methods may be applied to many distinct classes. Use with care.

/**
 * \@pcategoryimplementation defines the implementation for a category named \a CATEGORY on protocol \a
 * PROTOCOL. Protocol categories contain methods that are automatically applied
 * to any class that declares itself to conform to \a PROTOCOL. This macro
 * should be used in implementation files.
 *
 * To perform tasks when a protocol category is loaded, use the \c +initialize
 * method. This method in a protocol category is treated similarly to \c +load
 * in regular categories â€“ it will be executed at most once per protocol
 * category, and is not added to any classes which receive the protocol
 * category's methods. Note, however, that the category's methods may not have
 * been added to all conforming classes at the time that \c +initialize is
 * invoked. If no class conforms to \a PROTOCOL, \c +initialize may never be
 * called.
 *
 * There is intentionally no supported way to inject an \c +initialize method
 * as part of a protocol category.
 *
 * @note You cannot access instance variables in a protocol category, except
 * through defined accessor methods.
 *
 * @warning You should not invoke methods against \c super in the implementation
 * of a concrete protocol, as the superclass may not be the type you expect (and
 * may not even inherit from \c NSObject).
